# ASMA Project - Zengler Lab Additional Core Metadata Template

This repository contains the standardized **Additional Core Metadata** format for Zengler Lab contributions to the **ASMA** (Airway Synthetic Microbial Atlas) project.

The file [`zengler_lab_additional_core_metadata_template.csv`](./zengler_lab_additional_core_metadata_template.csv) captures key metadata necessary for internal data integration, downstream quality control, and multi-omics alignment across the ASMA platform.

## üìÅ File Overview

- **Filename**: `zengler_lab_additional_core_metadata_template.csv`
- **Each row = one biological sample**
- Supports multiple omics data types: `metaG`, `metaT`, `metaRS`, etc.
- Focused on structured, machine-readable metadata to support automation, validation, and reproducibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- `adapter_sequence`: Optional. Populate only if non-standard adapter sequences were used or if relevant to analysis.
- `rRNA_depletion_protocol` and `host_depletion_method` should use **controlled vocabularies** to ensure consistency and filterability.
- `project_id`: Defaults to `PROTECT`, but future datasets may use other identifiers (e.g., `CAMP`, `ZENG2026`).
- `collection_date` and `subject_id` may be PHI-sensitive. Retained in full for internal use; masking or removal may be required before public release.
- This metadata template is intended for internal ASMA data integration. External versions may require redaction or transformation of certain fields.
