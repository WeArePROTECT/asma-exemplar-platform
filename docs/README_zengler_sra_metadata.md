# ASMA Project - Zengler Lab SRA Metadata Template

This repository contains the standardized metadata format for Zengler Lab contributions to the **ASMA** (Airway Synthetic Microbial Atlas) project.

The file [`zengler_lab_sra_metadata_template.csv`](./zengler_lab_sra_metadata_template.csv) captures detailed metadata for each sequencing library submitted by the Zengler lab, formatted to support:

- SRA (Sequence Read Archive) submission via NCBI
- Integration into ASMA‚Äôs data pipeline and KBase backend
- Cross-omics traceability and reproducibility

---

## üìÅ File Overview

- **Filename**: `zengler_lab_sra_metadata_template.csv`
- **Each row = one sequencing library**
- Supports multiple omics types: `metaG`, `metaT`, `metaRS`

---

## üß¨ What is SRA?

**SRA** stands for **Sequence Read Archive**, a public repository managed by NCBI that stores raw sequencing data. Submitting to SRA ensures reproducibility, accessibility, and long-term preservation of experimental data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- Fields like `filename` and `filename2` must match real FASTQ files delivered with each dataset.
- Protocol summaries should be brief. Full protocol details should be linked via `protocols_io_id`.
- We recommend storing a canonical copy of this template in the ASMA GitHub repo.
