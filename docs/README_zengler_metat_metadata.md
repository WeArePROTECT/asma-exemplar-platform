# Zengler Lab - MetaT Metadata Documentation

This README describes the metadata fields provided in the `zengler_lab_metat_template.csv` file for metatranscriptomic (MetaT) data generated by the Zengler Lab. These metadata fields support sample tracking, quality control, and downstream analyses in the ASMA Exemplar Platform.

## ðŸ“‘ Column Descriptions

### `rna_extraction_kit`
- **Description**: Name of the kit or method used to extract total RNA from the sample.
- **Example**: "Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit"

### `input_sample_vol`
- **Description**: Volume (in ÂµL) of the input sample used for RNA extraction.
- **Example**: "100"

### `depth_target`
- **Description**: Targeted sequencing depth (e.g., in millions of reads or base pairs).
- **Example**: "20M reads"

### `rrna_depletion_kit`
- **Description**: Name of the rRNA depletion kit or method used prior to sequencing.
- **Example**: "Ribo-Zero Plus"

### `library_preparation_protocol`
- **Description**: Protocol used for preparing cDNA libraries for sequencing.
- **Example**: "NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep"

### `cdna_conversion_method`
- **Description**: Method or kit used for reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA.
- **Example**: "SuperScript IV"
- **Note**: Optional but useful for troubleshooting or interpreting transcriptomic results.

### `strand_specific`
- **Description**: Indicates if the library prep preserves strand orientation of transcripts.
- **Values**: "Yes" or "No"
- **Note**: Optional but recommended for transcriptomics.

### `fragment_size`
- **Description**: Approximate fragment size of the final cDNA library (in bp).
- **Example**: "300"
- **Note**: Optional but useful for downstream analysis and alignment.

### `rRNA_content_percent`
- **Description**: Percent of reads mapping to rRNA after depletion.
- **Example**: "2.5"
- **Note**: *Optional*. This is a quality control metric derived post-sequencing and can be included if available.

### `mapping_rate_to_db`
- **Description**: Percentage of reads that successfully map to reference database(s).
- **Example**: "85.4"
- **Note**: *Optional*. Represents a downstream QC metric and is not required for metadata submission.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes
- All fields are required unless marked as **Optional**.
- If a field is not applicable or unknown, use "NA" or leave blank with explanation.
- Optional fields are encouraged if information is available, especially for troubleshooting or downstream QC.
