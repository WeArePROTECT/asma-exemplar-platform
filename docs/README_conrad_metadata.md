# ASMA Project - Conrad Lab Metadata Template

This repository contains the standardized **metadata template** for Conrad Lab contributions to the **ASMA** (Airway Synthetic Microbial Atlas) project.

The file [`conrad_lab_metadata_template.csv`](./conrad_lab_metadata_template.csv) captures metadata fields specific to Conrad Lab sample and protocol descriptions, supporting consistent intake into the ASMA platform.

This metadata supports:
- Internal ASMA platform integration
- Downstream reproducibility and documentation
- Harmonization of metadata across contributing labs

## üìÅ File Overview

- **Filename**: `conrad_lab_metadata_template.csv`
- **Each row = one sample or data processing instance**
- Structured to support per-sample metadata entries
- Designed to complement metadata from other ASMA contributors (e.g., Zengler Lab)

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- This template is **specific to Conrad Lab** metadata and should align with ASMA-wide metadata standards.
- If values are shared across multiple samples (e.g., same library prep protocol), consider recording them once and referencing via a `protocol_id`.
- Consistent use of controlled vocabulary (e.g., for `sample_type` or `data_type`) is encouraged.
